App Brainstorming:
    Notes 
        -Synchying accross devices- Syncing across devices- I really like how I can view my notes whether on my phone, tablet, or PC.
        Tagging and Organizing - Having to efficiently and accurately organize my notes.
    Maps
        -Real-Time Navigation- Being able to go wherever I want and knowing where I am makes this software beneficial to me.
        Local Business Information- knowing where businesses, grocery stores, and restaurants are located and what time they open is another useful feature of this app. 
    Snapchat 
        -Ephermal sharing Snapchat's- The feature that makes stuff disappear after a certain period of time is very cool. It encourages us to share honest, in-the-moment photos without worrying about them being lost forever.
        AR Filters- I love the innovative filters and lenses. They make taking images and films more enjoyable and interactive.
App Idea: 
    I want to create an app that can let people socially interact and collaborate, similar to Khan Academy but focused on individuals engaging with others rather than just schoolwork. I want it to be able to allow those who do not have free access to education to view this app and work their way through it. It would be about from kindergarten to college level classes, just the notion of these people knowing how life works at this time and how the world operates.
